# MAMP & WordPress  

***  

## Install and Run WordPress on MAMP  

Installing and running WordPress on a local machine can be an essential practice before deploying your project, as well as after your project is deployed.  

You can mirror an entire project (site file and database) using MAMP. This can be extremely useful when you need to test new functionalities or troubleshoot issues. By testing locally with MAMP, you don't need to worry about breaking a *live* project, or worry about an Internet connection.  

## What is MAMP?  

MAMP installs an **AMP stack** on your computer.  

* AMP  
    - A: Apache --> Web Server
    - M: MySQL  --> Relational Database  
    - P: PHP  --> Scripting Language  

MAMP is an install package that sets up all the components of the AMP stack and links them together, so you can use them. After MAMP is installed, you have a local web server on your machine you can access through your web browser without an Internet connection.
